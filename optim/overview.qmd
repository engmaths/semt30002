title: "Optimisation: Overview"
---

The weeks 7-11 will focus on optimisation algorithms and their use in scientific computing. We will cover a range of numerical algorithms including gradient-based methods (e.g., Adam - used for training neural networks), gradient-free methods (e.g., Nelder-Mead and genetic algorithms), linear programming (often used for optimising business processes), and (mixed) integer linear programming.

* [Week 7: Gradient-based optimisation](week7.qmd)
* [Week 8: Gradient-free optimisation](week8.qmd)
* [Week 9: Linear programming](week9.qmd)
  * [Installing Pyomo](installing-pyomo.qmd)
* [Week 10: Integer programming](week10.qmd)
