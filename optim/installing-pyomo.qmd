# Installing Pyomo

Pyomo is a Python wrapper around various solvers written in other languages. While Pyomo itself can be installed easily via `pip` or `conda`, it can be harder to install the solvers.

## Installation via Conda (existing install)

If you have installed Python via [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/miniconda-install/) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), then you can install the required packages directly with `conda`.

From a terminal (Windows start menu → Terminal), run

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pyomo glpk ipopt
```

To install Pyomo and the GLPK/Ipopt solvers. If the command is not found, you might need to run this command from an Anaconda command line (it might be an option on your start menu). 

## Installation via Conda (new install)

Download and install [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/miniconda-install/). Since this is a new installation, you will need to install various packages. I recommend running the following from a terminal (Windows start menu → Terminal) to install common packages:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge scipy numpy matplotlib ipython pyomo glpk ipopt
```

If the command is not found, it means that `conda` is not on your system path (i.e., the list of folders that Windows searches for programs to run). If you installed Miniconda in the default place, you should be able to change to the installation folder and run the command from there:

```bash
cd \Users\Your Username\AppData\Local\miniconda3\Scripts
conda install -c conda-forge scipy numpy matplotlib ipython pyomo glpk ipopt
```

or (on some installs)

```bash
cd \Users\Your Username\miniconda3\Scripts
conda install -c conda-forge scipy numpy matplotlib ipython pyomo glpk ipopt
```

If you use PyCharm, Spyder, or VS Code, you will need to change the Python interpreter they use to the new one.

- [Spyder instructions](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/faq.html) - see "How do I get Spyder to work with my existing Python packages/environment"
- [VS Code instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments)

## Installing GLPK directly

If you can install Pyomo using `pip` (e.g., `pip install pyomo`), you can then add solvers manually. GLPK is a basic solver but sufficient for most of our needs. You can download `winglpk-4.65.zip` from <https://sourceforge.net/projects/winglpk/files/winglpk/GLPK-4.65/>. You need two files from the zip: `w64\glpk_4_65.dll` and `w64\glpsol.exe`. The installation guide of GLPK recommends adding these files to the folder `C:\Windows\System32` or another folder that is present on your path (i.e., the list of folders that Windows searches for programs to run).

## Using Google Colab

If you have a Google account, you have free access to [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). This provides a notebook-style interface to cloud-based computers with Python already installed. Simply create a new notebook in Colab and add these lines to the top of the notebook:

```bash
!pip install pyomo
!apt install -y -qq glpk-utils
```

These commands need to be run each time you re-open the notebook, but they only need to be run once per session. As such, it is best to keep them in a cell that is separate from the rest of your work at the top of the notebook.
