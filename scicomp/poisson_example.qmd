# Overview

The code below solves the Poisson equation
$$
\pdd{u}{x} + \pdd{u}{y} + q = 0
$$
where $q$ is a constant on a rectangular domain given by $a \leq x \leq b$ and $c \leq y \leq d$.  Dirichlet boundary conditions given by $u = 0$ are imposed at all four boundaries.

create this as a 2D array named u_0.  Then we convert
