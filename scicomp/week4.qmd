# Overview

This week we focus on an first-order PDEs.  These are PDEs that only involve first-order partial derivatives.  Although these are the simplest of all PDEs, they lead to surprising numerical challenges.  In particular, the finite-difference discretisation needs to adapt to the sign of the coefficient in front of the spatial derivative (the wave speed).  Choosing a numerically stable discretisation requires a consideration of the direction of wave propagation.  Adapting the spatial discretisation based on the direction of wave propagation is called **upwinding**.  

In this unit, we will use the upwind scheme to numerically solve first-order PDEs.  Although this method is simple, it suffers from **numerical diffusion**.  This leads to the numerical solution artifically spreading out.  Moreover, there is also a restriction on the time step that is set by the **CFL condition**.

# Exercises

1. Solve the linear advection equation given by
$$
\pd{u}{t} + v \pd{u}{x} = 0
$$
where $v$ is a constant.  Take the domain to be $0 \leq x \leq 5$ and $0 \leq t \leq 4$.  Set the initial condition to $u(x,0) = x / 5$.
    a) Solve with $v = 1$ and the boundary condition $u(0, t) = 0$. 
    Validate your code using the exact solution
    $$
    u(x,t) = \begin{cases} 
    0, \quad &0 \leq x \leq t, \\
    \frac{1}{5}(x - t), \quad &t \leq x \leq 5.
    \end{cases}
    $$
    b) Solve with $v = -1$ and the boundary condition $u(5, t) = 1$. Validate your code using the exact solution
    $$
    u(x,t) = \begin{cases} 
    \frac{1}{5}(x + t), \quad &0 \leq x \leq 5 - t, \\
    1, \quad &5 - t \leq x \leq 5.
    \end{cases}
    $$
    c) Use the velocity decomposition to write an upwind scheme that can simultaneously handle both of these cases.

1. The upwind scheme has a truncation error that is $O(\Delta x)$ in space and $O(\Delta t)$ in time.  Show that your code produces solutions with the expected accuracy.  **Hint**: One way to do this is to consider the problem in exercise 1a.  Compare your numerical approximation to $u(5,4)$ to the exact value of $1/5$ by fixing $\Delta t$ and varying $\Delta x$ and vice-versa.

1. Consider again the problem in exercise 1a.  Set $N = 100$ so that
$\Delta x$ is now fixed.  Now choose values of $\Delta t$ so that the
CFL number is set to $C = 0.5$, $C = 0.75$, and $C = 1$.  On the same axes, plot $u(x,4)$ for all three cases along with the exact solution.  What happens when $C$ is increased to one?  How you can explain the results in term of the truncation error and the numerical diffusion coefficient?

2. Solve the linear advection equation given by
$$
\pd{u}{t} + v(x,t)\pd{u}{x} = 0
$$
on the domain $-1 \leq x \leq 1$.  Let the velocity be given by $v(x, t) = x$.  Notice that $v < 0$ for $x < 0$ and $v > 0$ for $x > 0$.
Take the initial condition to be $u(x,0) = 1 - x^2$.  Do boundary conditions need to be imposed for this problem?

2. Solve the hyperbolic conservation law
$$
\pd{u}{t} + \pd{}{x}\left(j(u)\right) = 0
$$
when $j(u) = u + u^3 / 3$.  Take the domain to be $-2 \leq x \leq 5$ and $0 \leq t \leq 2$. The initial condition can be set to $u(x,0) = \exp(-x^2)$.  If needed, set $u = 0$ at the boundaries.


2. Solve the forced inviscid Burgers' equation
$$
\pd{u}{t} + u \pd{u}{x} = 1
$$
over the domain $-\pi \leq x \leq \pi$ and $0 \leq t \leq 2$.
The initial condition can be set to $u(x,0) = \sin x$.  If boundary conditions are needed, set $u = t$ at the boundary.


## Answers to selected exercises

3. As C increases to one, the numerical solution becomes more accurate and there is less numerical diffusion.  From the formula for the truncation error, we see the numerical diffusion coefficient is proportional to $(1 - C)$.  Setting $C = 1$ therefore eliminates numerical diffusion.

4. No boundary conditions are needed
