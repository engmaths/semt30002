title: "Scientific Computing: overview"
---

The first five weeks will focus on how scientific computing can be applied to the numerical solution of ordinary and partial differential equations.  Although differential equations appear in many engineering contexts, they usually cannot be solved by hand.  Instead, numerical methods are needed to compute an approximate solution.
